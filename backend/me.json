    "story":"I started my life in St. Louis, Missouri. Growing up, I always had an interest in computers and technology. However, I did not initially pursue this in high school or during my freshman year of college. I attended American University in Washington D.C. as a Political Science major. While computers are a part of my life, I also have a passion for politics and government. Before college, I had worked for numerous political companies, helped at polls, and participated in my community. Because of this background, I thought that pursuing political science would be a good plan. However, this changed during the second semester of my freshman year. I was enrolled in a class where we would meet three times a week, and for one of the days, we would visit different government locations such as the White House or the Electoral College. At every visit, there would always be a speaker who talked about programming skills in the government and how they are important. I was already thinking about switching to CS, so this made it much easier. I now attend UMD and am almost done with the program before I enter the real world. During my time here, I have discovered that I have a passion for fullstack development and would like to pursue this in the real world. I plan to create more projects that show my skill set in the field."
